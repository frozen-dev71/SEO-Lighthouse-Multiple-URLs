In Firefox we use timeToNonBlankPaint (that is behind a Firefox preference).</p><h5 id="first-contentful-paint">First Contentful Paint</h5><p>First Contentful Paint (FCP) measures the time from navigation to the time when the browser renders the first bit of content from the DOM.</p><h5 id="largestContentfulPaint">Largest Contentful Paint</h5><p>The Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) metric reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport.</p><h5 id="timeToDomContentFlushed">Time To DOM Content Flushed</h5><p>Internal Firefox metric activated by setting the preference<i>dom.performance.time_to_dom_content_flushed.enabled</i>&nbsp;to true.</p><h5 id="timeToContentfulPaint">Time To Contentful Paint</h5><p>Firefox implementation of First Contentful Paint. Activated by setting the preference<i>dom.performance.time_to_contentful_paint.enabled</i>Â &nbsp;to true.</p><h5 id="timeToFirstInteractive">Time To First Interactive</h5><p>Firefox implementation of Time to first interactive. Activated by setting the preference<i>dom.performance.time_to_first_interactive.enabled</i>&nbsp;to true.</p><h5 id="loadEventEnd">Load Event End</h5><p>The time when the load event of the current document is completed.</p><h5 id="fullyLoaded">FullyLoaded</h5><p>The time when all assets in the page is downloaded. The value comes from the latest response in the HAR file.</p><h5 id="SpeedIndex">Speed Index</h5><p>The Speed Index is the average time at which visible parts of the page are displayed. It is expressed in milliseconds and dependent on size of the view port. It was created by Pat Meenan and you can checkout the full documentation&nbsp;<a href="https://sites.google.com/a/webpagetest.org/docs/using-webpagetest/metrics/speed-index">here</a>.</p><h5 id="ContentfulSpeedIndex">Contentful Speed Index</h5><p>This new metric is developed by Bas Schouten at Mozilla which uses edge detection to calculate the amount of "content" that is visible on each frame. It was primarily designed for two main purposes: Have a good metric to measure the amount of text that is visible. Design a metric that is not easily fooled by the pop up splash/login screens that commonly occur at the end of a page load. These can often disturb the speed index numbers since the last frame that is being used as reference is not accurate.</p><h5 id="FirstVisualChange">First Visual Change</h5><p>The time when something for the first time is painted within the viewport. Calculated by analysing a video.</p><h5 id="VisualComplete85">Visual Complete 85%</h5><p>When the page is visually complete to 85% (or more). Calculated by analysing a video.</p><h5 id="VisualComplete95">Visual Complete 95%</h5><p>When the page is visually complete to 95% (or more). Calculated by analysing a video.</p><h5 id="VisualComplete99">Visual Complete 99%</h5><p>When the page is visually complete to 99% (or more). Calculated by analysing a video.</p><h5 id="LastVisualChange">Last Visual Change</h5><p>The time when something for the last time changes within the viewport. Calculated by analysing a video.</p><h5 id="LargestImage">Largest Image</h5><p>The time when the largest image within the viewport has finished painted at the final position on the screen. Calculated by analysing a video.</p><h5 id="Heading">Heading</h5><p>The time when the largest H1 heading within the viewport has finished painted at the final position on the screen. Calculated by analysing a video.</p><h5 id="Logo">Logo</h5><p>The time when the logo (configured with --scriptInput.visualElements) within the viewport has finished painted at the final position on the screen. Calculated by analysing a video.</p><h5 id="rumSpeedIndex">RUM-SpeedIndex</h5><p>A browser version also created by Pat Meenan that calculates the SpeedIndex measurements using Resource Timings. It is not as perfect as Speed Index but a good start.</p><h5 id="imageSizePerPage">Image transfer size per page</h5><p>The size of images per page.</p><h5 id="cssSizePerPage">CSS transfer size per page</h5><p>The transfer size of CSS per page, meaning if the CSS is sent compressed the unpacked size is larger.</p><h5 id="jsSizePerPage">JavaScript transfer size per page</h5><p>The transfer size of JavaScript per page.</p><h5 id="fontSizePerPage">Font transfer size per page</h5><p>The transfer size of fonts per page.</p><h5 id="htmlSizePerPage">HTML transfer size per page</h5><p>The transfer size of HTML per page.</p><h5 id="totalSizePerPage">Total transfer size per page</h5><p>The total transfer size of all assets on a page.</p><h5 id="imageRequestsPerPage">Image requests per page</h5><p>The number of image requests on a page.</p><h5 id="cssRequestsPerPage">CSS requests per page</h5><p>The number of CSS requests on a page.</p><h5 id="jsRequestsPerPage">JavaScript requests per page</h5><p>The number of JavaScript requests on a page.</p><h5 id="fontRequestsPerPage">Font requests per page</h5><p>The number of font requests on a page.</p><h5 id="totalRequestsPerPage">Total amount of requests per page</h5><p>The total amount of requests on a page.</p><h5 id="axeCriticalViolations">Critical Axe violations</h5><p>The number of critical accessibility violations on your page found by Axe.  A critical violation means that you should fix it now.</p><h5 id="axeSeriousViolations">Serious Axe violations</h5><p>The number of serious accessibility violations on your page found by Axe.  A serious violation means that you should fix it now.</p><h5 id="axeMinorViolations">Minor Axe violations</h5><p>The number of monir accessibility violations on your page found by Axe.</p><h5 id="axeModeratelViolations">Moderate Axe violations</h5><p>The number of moderate accessibility violations on your page found by Axe.</p><h5 id="totalBlockingTime">Total Blocking Time</h5><p>The blocking time of a given long task is its duration in excess of 50 ms (or the time you have configured with <code>--browsertime.minLongTaskLength</code>). And the total blocking time for a page is the sum of the blocking time for each long task that happens after first contentful paint.</p><h5 id="maxPotentialFid">Max Potential First Input Delay</h5><p>The worst-case First Input Delay that your users might experience during load. This is calculated using CPU long tasks.</p><h5 id="firstInputDelay">First Input Delay</h5><p>First Input Delay measures the time from when a user first interacts with your site (when they click a link, tap on a button etc) to the time when the browser is actually able to respond to that interaction. You need to <a href="https://www.sitespeed.io/documentation/sitespeed.io/scripting/#measuring-first-input-delay---fid">use scripting</a> to actively do something with the page for this metric to be collected.</p><footer><hr><p><a href="https://www.sitespeed.io">sitespeed.io</a>  13.3.2  by <a href="https://www.sitespeed.io/aboutus/">the sitespeed.io team</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.md">contributors</a></p></footer></div><script src="js/sortable.min.js"></script><script src="js/chartist.min.js"></script><script src="js/chartist-plugin-axistitle.min.js"></script><script src="js/chartist-plugin-tooltip.min.js"></script></body></html>
